# DERT C++ Tools
This is an extention used for FRC Team DERT 2040. It does not make sense to use it if you are not in DERT. However in the future there might be a feature that will let you set up your wpilib project to use it.

## Features
Commands:
* "Create C++ Component": Creates a cpp and h file in the component folders
*   "Create C++ Library": Creates a cpp and h file in the library folders

## Requirements
If you have any requirements or dependencies, add a section describing those and how to install and configure them.

## Release Notes
Inital Release: Added two commands
* "Create C++ Component": Creates a cpp and h file in the component folders
* "Create C++ Library": Creates a cpp and h file in the library folders
